# Statamic Translations

**Archived in favor of [statamic/i18n](https://github.com/statamic/i18n)**

This is a collection of the Statamic translation files, we try to keep them up to date as soon as a new version releases.

To use these, put them in `site/lang` and change your locale / control panel locale to which one you prefer.
